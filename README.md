### `review-paper` — Pre-Submission Referee Report

Runs a rigorous pre-submission review of an academic paper, simulating the scrutiny of a specific journal's editorial board. Six specialized review agents run in parallel and their findings are consolidated into a single structured report.

**What it reviews:**

| Agent | Focus |
|---|---|
| 1 | Spelling, grammar, and academic style |
| 2 | Internal consistency and cross-reference verification |
| 3 | Unsupported claims and identification integrity |
| 4 | Mathematics, equations, and notation |
| 5 | Tables, figures, and their documentation |
| 6 | Contribution evaluation (adversarial journal-specific referee) |

**Usage:**

From within the paper's directory, run:

```
/review-paper                        # auto-detect paper, generic standards
/review-paper QJE                    # QJE-specific referee persona
/review-paper JF path/to/main.tex    # Journal of Finance persona + explicit file path
```

Recognized journal names (case-insensitive):

| Category | Journals |
|---|---|
| Top-5 economics | `AER`, `QJE`, `JPE`, `Econometrica`, `REStud` |
| Finance | `JF`, `JFE`, `RFS`, `JFQA` |
| Macro | `AEJMacro`, `JME`, `RED` |

If no journal is specified, the review applies high general standards without a specific journal persona. The file path is also optional — the skill auto-detects the main `.tex` file if not provided.

The consolidated report is saved to `PRE_SUBMISSION_REVIEW_[YYYY-MM-DD].md` in the current directory. If you prefer a specific folder, edit "review-paper.md". 

**Customization:**

The skill is designed to be extended in two ways.

*Adding journals or fields:* Open the skill file and add your journal's abbreviation to the recognized names list in Phase 1. Agent 6 will automatically adopt the appropriate editorial persona based on its training knowledge of that journal. The same approach works for other disciplines — sociology, political science, psychology — by specifying the target journal when invoking the skill.

*Adding project-specific context:* You can ask Claude to inject context about your specific paper before running the skill. For example: "Before running /review-paper, note that this paper uses a regression discontinuity design and the main identification concern is sorting around the threshold." Claude will carry that context into the review. A more durable approach is to put project-specific instructions in a `CLAUDE.md` file in your project directory — Claude Code reads this automatically and the agents will have access to it when reviewing your paper.

*Changing folder structure:* In the baseline specification of this tool, Claude will search through folders looking for tables and figures. You can simply put in your own file paths to make it slightly easier. If you prefer to get the feedback saved somewhere else, you can also change the path for where the final report is saved. 

**Requirements:**

- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) with access to the `general-purpose` subagent (i.e., the Agent tool must be available).
- The paper must be in LaTeX format. The skill reads `.tex` files and optionally inspects figure and table files.

**Installation:**

Copy [Paper-review/review-paper.md](Paper-review/review-paper.md) into your Claude Code skills directory:

```
~/.claude/commands/review-paper.md
```

or into a project-level skills directory (`.claude/commands/review-paper.md` relative to the project root) if you prefer per-project installation.
